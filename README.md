Add https://github.com/believethehype/umbrelapps to communiity Appstores and install Nostr-Wallet-Connect. Once you installed, open the app and you will see a public key that you can copy and paste into the "Wallet Connect Pubkey" field in your Client. Add a Wallet- Connect Relay (eg. wss://relay.damus.io) and optionally add a Wallet Connect Secret (e.g. create a new nostr privatekey in hex and paste it).

Projects in this repo are under development, use at own risk.
